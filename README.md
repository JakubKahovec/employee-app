The Employee application displays the dashboard with employes information and allows to add a new employee.

It's based on the stack of React (CRA), Typescript, Redux-Observable and AntD. 
It's feature complete, including the charts on the dashboard. Note that the changes to the app are not persisted, so after the page refresh they will be gone.

Things to improve:
  - There is only basic styling
  - It can be tested more thoroughly, especially the page for saving a new employee
